# VCA Canada Intune/AutoPilot Setup

## Preamble

This guide is written as a reference for the Insight Canada lab teams when configuring computers with AutoPilot via Microsoft Intune.

## Initial Enrollment

### Laptops for personal use (most common)

This enrollment configuration is utilized when a laptop is ordered for a specific person in the hospitals and is not being used for a special application. Enroll the device into AutoPilot using the *VCAC* group tag.

**Group Tag:** *VCAC*

### Laptops for x-ray/diagnostic use

**IMPORTANT:** This configuration is not yet complete, please ship all laptops/computers being used for x-ray/diagnostic setups to the VCA Canada Support Office for final provisioning.

**(NOT YET IN PLACE)**: The enrollment configuration is used for laptops being setup with diagnostic software (i.e. an x-ray suite), it will use the group tag called *VCAC-DIAG*

**Future Group Tag:** *VCAC-DIAG*

### Other computer configurations (i.e. Heska)

This configurations are not yet setup with Intune + AutoPilot, please ship computers destined for this use to the VCA Canada Support Office for final provisioning.
